      "*We consider a diffusion problem* $T_{t} = kT_{xx},$ *modeling the temperature in a solid body. Two pieces of the same material, with different temperatures, are brought together at $t=0$. The condition at $t=0$ can be formulated as $T(x,0)=T_0$ for $x\\in[0,L/2)$ and $T(x,0)=T1\\neq T0$ for $x\\in[L/2,L]$. The PDE will then predict how the initially discontinuous temperature develops in time and space.*\n",
