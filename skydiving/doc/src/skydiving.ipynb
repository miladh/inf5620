Newton's second law of motion applied to the body says that the sum ofthese forces must equal the mass of the body times its acceleration $a$ in the vertical direction. Taking downward as positive direction, Newton's second law gives us\n",

A skydiver in spread-eagle formation has a cross-section of $0.5 m^2$ in the horizontal plane, while when the parachute is open the cross-section area perpendicular to the motion is $44 m^2$. The density of air is set to be constant, $1$kg/m3. The drag coefficient for a man in upright position can be set to $1.2$, while for an open parachute it can be taken as $1.8$. We sssume that it takes $5$s to increase the area linearly from the original to the final value. One can take the drag coefficient as a piecewise constant function with an abrupt change when the parachute is open. We start with zero velocity and release the parachute after $t_p=60$ s."
